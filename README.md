# Harsh-driving-detection-system
It is used for the design and development of the harsh driving detection system. This will classify driving style as safe or harsh using ML classification model. If the driving trip contain harsh driving events, ML model will detect those driving events based on vehicle on trajectory data collected using MPU9250.
