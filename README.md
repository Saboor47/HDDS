# Harsh Driving Detection System (HDDS)

This is the research project for the design and development of the Harsh Driving Detection System that can accurately detect and classify harsh driving events when driving data is passed to the trained algorithm. The primary features/parameters that we are using for the classification of harsh driving events are sudden acceleration, sudden braking, aggressive left or right line changing, and sudden left or right turning. In this project, our main focus was on the design and development of an ML algorithm that can accurately classify driving style as safe or harsh and if the driving was harsh then which harsh driving events were performed during a complete driving trip. Initially, SVM, DT, and RF ML models were trained, then after model evaluation, the RF model was used for final field trials.
